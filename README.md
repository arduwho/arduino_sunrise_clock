# arduino_sunrise_clock
This project is a so-called sunrise alarm clock.  It is inspired by the various sunrise alarm clocks on the market now.

In addition to a display which shows the time and date, it has an alarm function.  The alarm gradually turns on a LED panel instead of making sound; maybe I'll add
an audible alarm later.

Starting from a preset number of minutes before the desired wakeup time, the LED panel begins ramping up to full brightness.  Once alarm time has been reached, it keeps full brightness for a set number of minutes after wake-up time.  

I built mine from the following main parts:

Clone Arduino Pro Mini
DS1307 RTC
16x2 LCD display
LED strip lighting
